# Automatic-Windshield-Wiper

- This project is an Arduino-based automatic wiper system using servo motors and an analog rain sensor.
- Two servos were programmed (via PWM) to achieve smooth wiper motion using precise angle increments and delays
  for varied speed profiles.
- Implemented modular logic in C++ to simulate different wiper speeds corresponding to
  light, moderate, and heavy rain conditions based on the analog rain sensor values.
